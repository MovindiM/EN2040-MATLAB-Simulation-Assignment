# EN2040-MATLAB-Simulation-Assignment
This is a MATLAB simulation assignment submitted for EN2040-Random Signals and Processes at the Department of Electronic and Telecommunication Engineering, University of Moratuwa

Here I studied the behavior of a sampled signal that is passes thourgh a channel corrupted by additive white Gaussian noise (AWGN) of zero mean and variance Ïƒ^2 at the sending and receiving ends.
